## Background

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, revealing insights into the microbial diversity present in the human body.

The dataset shows that a small handful of microbial species (also known as operational taxonomic units or OTUs) are present in over 70% of individuals, while the rest of the species are relatively rare. This dashboard provides an engaging and informative way to visualize and interact with this fascinating dataset.

## Project Overview

This project builds an interactive dashboard using JavaScript, HTML, and D3.js that allows users to:
- View detailed demographic information about individuals.
- Explore the microbial species (OTUs) present in different individualsâ€™ belly buttons.
- Visualize the relative abundances of different species using bar charts, bubble charts, and other interactive graphs.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts**: The dashboard provides various visualizations such as bar charts and bubble charts, enabling users to explore the diversity of microbiomes in human navels.
- **Demographic Information**: Users can select individuals from a dropdown menu to view demographic details such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Microbial Diversity Exploration**: The dataset contains a wide range of microbial species, and the dashboard lets users explore which species are most common and which are rare across different individuals.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For building the interactivity of the dashboard.
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the dashboard.
- **Bootstrap**: To design responsive and mobile-friendly layouts.

## Dataset

The dataset is a collection of microbial data from human belly buttons, including:
- Demographic information about each individual (e.g., age, gender).
- The presence and relative abundance of different microbial species (OTUs) across individuals.

You can access the dataset directly from the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://github.com/Plotly/datasets/tree/master/belly_button_biodiversity) (link to external site).
